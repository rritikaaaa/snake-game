# Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to control a snake and eat fruits to grow longer.
However, the game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundary walls.

# Gameplay
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
The snake grows longer every time it eats a fruit.
The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundary walls.
The score increases with each fruit eaten.
